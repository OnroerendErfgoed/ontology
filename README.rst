Onroerend Erfgoed Ontology
==========================

This repository contains an ontology used for modelling Onroerend Erfgoed
heritage information systems in a linked open data context. It's intented to
describe the information objects used in our systems, their properties and
relations.

This is very much a work in progress and by it's very nature incomplete.
